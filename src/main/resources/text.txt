Modern-day batteries have seen dramatic improvements in their capacity and charging speeds. However, 
with the progressive miniaturization of electronics, researchers have started to explore whether quantumness can 
be a resource for improving battery technology. Recent work, for instance, has suggested that quantum effects, 
from coherence to entanglement, could one day be harnessed to build “quantum batteries” whose charging speeds may 
exceed those of their classical counterparts. So far, however, an exact theoretical estimation of how large this 
speedup can be was lacking. Now, Ju-Yeon Gyhm of the Institute of Basic Science in the Republic of Korea and 
colleagues prove that the charging speed of quantum batteries can scale at most quadratically with the number 
of cells making up the battery [1]. This quadratic scaling implies a potentially large quantum advantage over 
classical batteries, whose charging speed scales linearly with the number of cells.
